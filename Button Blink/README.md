# Button Blink
Sean Hastings: Button Blink uses an infinite while loop to check when a button press happens in order to turn on an LED. All boards have implemented button blink successfully.

## Extra Work

### Color Change
The MSP430FR5994 uses the button to toggle between blinking the green LED and the red LED.
